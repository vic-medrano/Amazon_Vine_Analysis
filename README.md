# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project was to analyze reviews written by members of the Amazon Vine program. This program allows sellers to recieve reviews for their products. These reviews are provided by Amazon Vine members who are often provided a product and receive financial compensation for publishing a review. Amazon provides approximately 50 datasets with reviews of specific products from different categories. This analysis was conducted with a dataset that contains reviews on books. 
## Results
To determine if there was any possible bias between customers who are paid members of the vine program and those who are not, the data was filtered to analyze these two groups. However this dataset is not the best to analyze members of the vine program as there were no members in this particular dataset for reviews on books.

- We can see that there were 403,807 total reviews. All reviews were from members who do not belong to the vine program.
- There were 242,889 5-star reviews making the five star reviews account for 60% of the total reviews.

## Summary
- It does not seem as though there is any positive bias given that these customers had no incentive to review and no incentive to leave a positive review as they were not members of the vine program. Without having any data of book reviews from vine users it is difficult to determine whether vine members ratings would have affected the data. Another analysis could be conducted to look at the star rating and the helpful votes to see if star rating for a product is related to the amount of helpful votes. It may also be helpful to further classify the helpful votes and understand whether they were written to show the product negatively or positively.
